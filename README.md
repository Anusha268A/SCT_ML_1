# Task 1: Predict House Prices using Linear Regression
# Task 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective
Build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and neighborhood.

## Dataset
- File: `data/train.csv`
- Contains features like `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, `FullBath`, `BedroomAbvGr`, `TotRmsAbvGrd`, `Neighborhood`, and target `SalePrice`.

## Notebook
- File: `notebooks/task1.ipynb`
- Implements data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, cross-validation, and feature coefficient analysis.
- Includes plots comparing actual vs predicted prices.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SCT_ML_1.git
